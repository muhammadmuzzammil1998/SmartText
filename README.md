# SmartText Â· [Demo](https://git.muzzammil.xyz/smarttext/?github)
Protect your messages with 256-bit encryption.

Note: The mcrypt extension has been deprecated in php7.2 because apparently it has been an "[abandonware for nearly a decade now, and was also fairly complex to use](http://php.net/manual/en/migration71.deprecated.php)." I'll do my best to keep it working on my website. If you want to give it a try follow [this](https://github.com/muhammadmuzzammil1998/SmartText/blob/master/README.md#build). You can still report bugs and stuff.

## Encryption
Smart Text uses AES-complaint, RIJNDAEL 256 bit encryption/decryption with php_mcrypt with CBC. Its open source and can be adjusted as needed.
## The 2-Passwords system
Dual password protection makes it even harder to brute force a way in to the encryption so that the message is secure and can be read by only those with both passwords. Also, your real passwords aren't used directly, there hashes are.
## Decryption
You can decrypt the message using this link https://git.muzzammil.xyz/smarttext/?do=decrypt and pasting the message there.

### Passwords for the encrypted string:
- Password #1: hellololpass1
- Password #2: hellololpass2
### MD-5: 1866fb41bbd2c62b99f8134bf0300b95
